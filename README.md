## Background

In this project, numeric features of the acoustic properties of calls of a large sample of bats in Mexico are analysed using machine learning techniques to try to predict the familiy of each bat.  Monitoring the prescence and diversity of bats using acoustic surveys is a useful way to detect biodiversity change, especially in remote areas, but machine learning algorithms are required to address the complexity of classification of individial families.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to classify the acoustic information to predict the target variable "Family" which is a categorical variable indicating the following 5 bat families: _Emballonuridae, Molossidae, Mormoopidae, Phyllostomidae, Vespertilionidae_.  

## Methods
The performance of a neural network with 2 hidden layers and a neural network with 3 hidden layers were compared with respect to their performance in predicting the type of bat family a call belongs to. 

## Conclusions

## Acknowledgements
This project was awarded an A grade as part of the coursework required for the module, "Machine Learning" for an a MSc (Data Analytics) course at UCD in 2022.
